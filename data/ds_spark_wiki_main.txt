Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally held at the Hawthorne Bridge 
in Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011, in response to an attack 
on a gay male couple one week earlier for holding hands while 
walking across the bridge. News of the attack spread throughout 
the Pacific Northwest and the United States. According to the couple 
and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Brad Forkner 
and Christopher Rosevear along the bridge before they were physically assaulted. 
The assault was condemned by Portland's gay mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief,
Mike Reese. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, an LGBT community center 
and non-profit organization, to form street patrols to monitor Portland's downtown area. 
Several LGBT and human rights organizations sponsored Hands Across Hawthorne in response to the attack, 
linking hands across the entire span of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. 
More than 4,000 people attended the rally.
